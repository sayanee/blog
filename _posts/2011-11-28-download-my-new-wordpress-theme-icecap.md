Yay! I just tidied up my very first wordpress theme! It is called Icecap and it's a white, minimal and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/">responsive</a> theme!

For a first timer, designing up the theme and coding it took about 2 weeks. And it involved right from whipping up the design in photoshop, meddling with php <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/">wordpress codex</a>, plus <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">scss</a> and <a href="http://www.css3.info/">css3</a>.

Seeing something through right from ideation to the product gives me great joy! If you like to try out, do ahead <a href="https://github.com/sayanee/Icecap/zipball/master">download</a> it, <a href="https://github.com/sayanee/Icecap">view the codes</a>, fork it or let me know your feedback through <a href="https://github.com/sayanee/Icecap/issues">github</a> or <a href="mailto:sayanee@gmail.com?Subject=Icecap%20Wordpress%20Theme">email</a> ;-)

Have fun and let me know how else can I improve it!
