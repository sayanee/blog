I have been using a bunch of application for inspiration, design, database, coding, testing and versioning purposes on my MAC OS Lion machine. I bought some apps and today i wanted to share the ones that are available for free. Here are my top 10 that I use frequently.

**1. LittleSnapper** (<a href="http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/">download</a>) for inspiration

I use LittleSnapper to collect for design inspirations. With an easy click of shift+command+4 in mac, I collect loads of screenshots for logo, homepage, manifesto, typography inspirations. LittleSnapper gives me a neat interface to categorize and annotate them.

**2. Virtual Box** (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">download</a>) for browser testing

A Windows machine on my MAC OS? I use Virtual Box to do all my IE and Windows-based browser testing. Since the application runs within my MAC, i do not even need to log out to do any Windows-based testing.

**3. Sublime Text** (<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/download">download</a>) for coding

This is a multi-purpose code writing app. If you are familiar with TextMate or Coda, give this a try too! It has built--in support for syntax highlighting, themes and plugins that makes it a powerful, yet a very light-weight editor. For continued use, you must buy the licence.

**4. Mou Editor** (<a href="http://mouapp.com/">download</a>) for writing

I create a <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> readme file for almost all projects and this neat markdown editor and viewer makes it easy to write in markdown and view its rendered html easily.

**5. Scout App** (<a href="http://mhs.github.com/scout-app/">download</a>) for coding

If you use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">sass</a> and <a href="http://compass-style.org/">compass</a> for your front-end design with css and do not want to use a command line, then this little app is neat.

**6. MAMP **(<a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/index.html">download</a>) for localhost

I use MAMP for localhost testing and development for wordpress generally. For a php, mysql and apache development, this is a neat tool for any local testing.

**7. GitX** (<a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/">download</a>) for versioning

I prefer to use the command line for git commands during coding, but after hours of coding, i fire up this app to give me a graphical overview of all the commit, branches and changes i did with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>.

**8. Go2Shell** (<a href="http://mac.softpedia.com/get/Utilities/Go2Shell.shtml">download</a>) for terminal

Every finder has this Go2Shell menu item for me and I can fire up a terminal window in the current directory of the Finder. I use it all the time! No more 'cd' to the correct directory with my working file.

**9. Total Terminal **(<a href="http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/">download</a>) for terminal

Go2Shell and Total Terminal go hand in hand when trying to access the terminal. With just a hot-key, the terminal window opens up and closes. This gives me a greater and faster control to work with the entire screen area with many windows open.

**10. Sequel Pro** (<a href="http://totalterminal.binaryage.com/">download</a>) for database

An easy MySQL database connection, management and view. This gives a neat table view for all the database elements.

Which one of the above 10 do you use as well and are there any other interesting ones?
