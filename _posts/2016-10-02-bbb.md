abstract: Running compiled Go on Beaglebone to interact with the GPIO pins
---

I have been busy learning 2 new things: [Beaglebone](http://beagleboard.org/), a single board computer and [Go](https://golang.org/), a programming language. It was especially fun running a compiled Go script and playing with the GPIO pins of the Beaglebone. In this blog, I wanna share how to run a simple digital write with a blinky LED and read analog values from a potentiometer.

## Pre-requisites

1. Install [Debian Linux for Beaglebone](https://beagleboard.org/latest-images) with an SD card.
- [SSH into the Beaglebone](https://learn.adafruit.com/ssh-to-beaglebone-black-over-usb?view=all) with IP address `192.168.7.2`
- Install [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language with `brew install go` in your development machine (local machine)
- Familiarise with the Beaglebone's GPIO pin layout

## Digital write

- Wire up a super simple LED circuit with `1kâ„¦` resistor and Beaglebone's `P8 pin 2 DGND` and `P8 pin 10 GPIO_68`
  ![](img/bbb-led.jpg)
- SSH into the BBB with `ssh root@192.168.7.2`
- Turn on and off the LED in the command line with

  ```sh
  echo high > /sys/class/gpio/gpio68/direction # LED ON
  echo low > /sys/class/gpio/gpio68/direction # LED OFF
  ```
- Wondering what does [Linux file systems's `/sys`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/sysfs.txt) do?

  > sysfs is a virtual file system provided by Linux. sysfs provides a set of virtual files by exporting information about various kernel subsystems, hardware devices and associated device drivers from the kernel's device model to user space.

- Write `high` or `low` to the `/sys/class` pin files to turn on and off the LED in Go programming language

  ```go
  // blinky.go
  package main

  import "fmt"
  import "io/ioutil"
  import "time"

  func check(e error) {
    if e != nil {
      panic(e)
    }
  }

  func main() {
    var status bool = false
    high := []byte("high")
    low := []byte("low")
    var gpio string = "/sys/class/gpio/gpio68/direction"
    for range time.Tick(time.Second \*1) {
      if status {
        status = false
        err := ioutil.WriteFile(gpio, high, 0644)
        check(err)
        fmt.Println("high")
      } else {
        status = true
        err := ioutil.WriteFile(gpio, low, 0644)
        check(err)
        fmt.Println("low")
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- Compile on OSX for Beaglebone

  ```sh
  GOARM=7 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux go build blinky.go
  ```
- Transfer the executable file `blinky` via ssh

  ```sh
  scp blinky root@192.168.7.2:/root
  ```
- Run the binary `blinky` in Beaglebone and see the LED turn on and off ðŸ’¥

  ```sh
  ./blinky
  ```

## Analog read

- Wire up a potentiometer to `P9_32` for `VDD (1.8V)`, `P9_34` for `GND` and `P9_33` for analog input pin
  ![](img/bbb-pot.jpg)
- SSH into the BBB with `ssh root@192.168.7.2`
- Setup the GPIO pins by adding the device

  ```sh
  echo "BB-ADC" >> /sys/devices/platform/bone_capemgr/slots
  ```
- Turn the potentiometer knob and read the 12-bit ADC values from `0` to `4095`

  ```sh
  cat /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/in_voltage4_raw
  ```
- Read file to get the analog sensor values in Go

  ```go
  // analogread.go
  package main

  import "fmt"
  import "io/ioutil"
  import "time"

  func check(e error) {
    if e != nil {
      panic(e)
    }
  }

  func main() {
    ticker := time.NewTicker(time.Millisecond * 500)
    var gpio string = "/sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:device0/in_voltage4_raw"

    go func() {
      for t := range ticker.C {
        b, err := ioutil.ReadFile(gpio)
        if err != nil {
          fmt.Print(err)
        }

        str := string(b)
        fmt.Println(str)
        fmt.Println("Tick at", t)
      }
    }()

    time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 60000) // run for 1 minute
    ticker.Stop()
    fmt.Println("Ticker stopped")
  }
  ```
- Compile on OSX for Beaglebone

  ```sh
  GOARM=7 GOARCH=arm GOOS=linux go build analogread.go
  ```
- Transfer the executable `analogread` via SSH

  ```sh
  scp analogread root@192.168.7.2:/root
  ```
- Run in Beaglebone `./analogread`
- Turn the potentiometer knob to see its ADC values change ðŸ’¥

## Conclusion

As one of the feature of Unix, [Everything is a file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file), it was fun to read or write to extract the values and interact with simple sensors and the Beaglebone. And because we are running the digital write and analog read programs on Linux, we can also use other programming language frameworks like [Adafruit's Beaglebone IO Python library](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python) or [Bonescript with Node.js](https://github.com/jadonk/bonescript).
